    I am a Machine Learning/Deep Learning enthusiast. 
    I have an affinity towards Artificial Intelligence (specifically Machine Learning and Deep Learning) and I aim at contributing as much as I can to these fields. 
    My research interests are Sequence Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks, Sequence to Sequence Models, 
    Siamese Network, Natural Language Understanding using Deep Learning, and Handwriting Recognition in Air. 
    My current research project is on Visual Question Answering using Multi Modal Reasoning.
     Apart from my interests in AI I have a keen interest in Web Application development, Music Composition and Music Production.

  about:             |
    I am currently a Master student in Computer Science in the University of Kaiserslautern. In the field, I have a strong interest for Machine Learning, with a special focus on Deep Neural Networks, having experience with the mainstream Machine Learning libraries.

    In the course of the last five years, I have also grown interest for the Cognitive Sciences (initially for Linguistics; later for Psychology and Philosophy; and currently for Computational Neuroscience, given my focus on Deep Learning), having worked in the area for a while.
